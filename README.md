# co-promisify

This has the same API as [co](https://github.com/visionmedia/co), except that
it returns a Promise instead of taking a thunk as last argument.

Because I canâ€™t wait for co to
[do this itself](https://github.com/visionmedia/co/pull/134).

Also, this is for use with [normalize](https://normalize.github.io/).
